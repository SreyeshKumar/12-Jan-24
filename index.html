		<p>Versicolor. The flowers are classified in terms of four inputs, namely, the sepal-width,
			sepal-length, petal-width, and petal-length. Figure 2 shows how two input values, namely
			petal-width and petal-length, are plotted in a Cartesian space. The figure illustrates the
			usefulness of scatter plots for identifying possible clusters of data points. This tool can
			convey enormous amounts of information in a compact representation. The user is able
			to view a data set by making a projection along any two input dimensions. The user uses
			this tool to obtain a general idea of the contents and quality of the data set</p>
		<p>      However, from a cooperative learning perspective, the main objective of the data
			visualization component is to visualize the portion of the data set covered by a particular
			rule, as described next. For example, Figure 2 depicts how the rule (henceforth referred
			to as Rule 1)</p>
		<p>      IF petal-width > 17.50 THEN Iris = Virginica</p>
		<p>is visualized by means of a scatter diagram. The diagram depicts the petal-width and petallength input dimensions. The scatter diagram shows the Virginica examples covered by
		the rule (in yellow), together with those examples that were not covered (in black or red).
		The diagram indicates that the petal-lengths of most Virginica Irises are larger than 46.50.
		Note that any two of the inputs can be depicted on the X-axis or Y-axis. This may lead
		to the identification of new clusters that are not described in the rule. For example, a new
		cluster identifying a relationship between the sepal-widths and petal-widths of Virginicas
		may be identified, merely by changing the two inputs displayed. This information may
		then subsequently be used to form a new rule to be used for further training (Viktor, le
		Roux, & Paquet, 2001).</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Visual Cooperative Learning</h3>
		<p>As stated previously, the CILT system currently incorporates the results of a
			number of data mining tools that are used for classification. The ViziMine tool imports
			the rules (or initial knowledge) produced by each tool as an ASCII file and subsequently
			represents the rules visually as part of the team. This allows the user to easily understand
			the rule, and provides an interface between the user and the data mining tool.</p>
		<p>The ViziMine tool thus provides the user with a detailed description of the current
state of each data mining tool. This interface also allows the user to incorporate his
knowledge into the system by participating as a learning team member.</p>
		<p>The visualization of, for example, a C4.5 decision tree, provides a user with an initial
understanding of the knowledge discovered. However, the ability to drag-and-drop the
rules onto the data and see the impact immediately allows the user first to understand
the rules, and then to play with various “what-if” analysis techniques. ViziMine allows
the user to achieve this by illustrating the rules visually on selected data axes by means
of a scatter plot of 2D data graphs. This is made possible by the easily comprehensible
interface, where the user can select a rule, either directly from one of the learners, or from
the manipulated rules of the domain expert, and then drop it onto the data visualization.
The portion of the data covered by the rule is subsequently shown on the data, as
illustrated in Figure 2.

		<p>The data-items (inputs) of the class that is covered by the rule are displayed in color,
while the data points of the complementary classes are displayed using round black dots.
For example, in Figure 2, the data-items of Iris types Setosa and Versicolor are shown as
round black dots. For the Virginica Irises, the data-items covered by Rule 1 are displayed
as diamond-shaped yellow dots. The data-items of Virginicas that are not covered by Rule
1 are indicated through the use of red triangles. This information is used to assess the
individual rule’s accuracy and coverage. By interacting in this way, the user can
understand the data that underlies a particular rule constructed by the data mining tool.
That is, a clearer understanding of the knowledge discovered by the various mining
toolsthat coexist in the cooperative learning environment is obtained.</p>
		<p>The user is also able to participate in the learning process by manually combining
parts of the rules. The Rule Builder models an individual data mining tool’s participation
during the cooperative learning phase, as discussed in earlier in the chapter. Note that
the learning team operates in one of two modes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In automatic mode, the cooperative learning phase is dynamically reiterated until
no new rules can be created. That is, the rule combining, data generation, and rule
pruning steps are completed without any feedback from the user. Here, the user acts
as a spectator, viewing the data mining tools’ cooperation. This is especially useful
when the user wishes to trace the learning process.</li>
			<li> In manual mode, the user actively participates in the learning process. He monitors
and guides the reiteration of new rules and the data generation process. Importantly, the user can promote the cooperation process by removing or adapting
rules. In this way, the user guides the learning process by incorporating his domain
knowledge into the system.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Rule Builder interface is shown in Figure 3. The top part of the interface displays
the rules as generated by the active learner. The current rule accuracy threshold, which</p>

		<p>is equal to the average rule accuracy, is displayed next. Here one will recall that this value
is used to distinguish between high- and low-quality rules. The window also displays
the newly generated rules. These rules are generated using the rule combination
algorithm described earlier. In this way, the visualization helps the user to easily
understand the various rules. For an expert user, the tool also provides an additional
function allowing the user to add his own rules to the combined knowledge.<br/>
As has been indicated, the three components essential for understanding a visual
model are high-quality representation, real-time interaction, and model and data integration. The current implementation of the ViziMine system thus addresses these three
requirements through the real-time integration of both data visualization and data mining
result visualization into one.<br/>
The next section discusses the use of three-dimensional visualization and virtual
reality as a powerful tool for visualizing the data during the data preprocessing and
mining processes</p>
		
		<h2 style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;" >THREE-DIMENSIONAL VISUALIZATION,
VIRTUAL REALITY AND DATA MINING</h2>
		
		<p>Three-dimensional visualization has the potential to show far more information than
two-dimensional visualization, while retaining its simplicity. Current and future research
efforts will include the ability to model relationships between data in a three-dimensional
rule grid. This visualization technique quickly reveals the quantity and relative strength
of relationships between elements, helping to focus attention on important data entities
and rules. It therefore aids both the data preprocessing and data mining processes.<br/>
Note that, although the data set and the data context determine the visualization
technique, the size also plays a very important role. Unfortunately, the more data items
on the visual graph, the more complex the graph becomes, and thus the user is faced with
information overload or the so-called “curse of dimensionality.”<br/>
The next section contains general considerations on Virtual Reality (VR) and data
mining, but most of the conclusions can be applied to the ViziMine tool as well. The
ViziMine tool relies on bidimensional visualization, but the importance of each rule can
be better visualized if three-dimensional visualization is utilized.</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: bolder" >Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
		<p>The curse of dimensionality is not restricted to data mining. This problem can arise
in information retrieval, and Bayesian and multivariate analysis, to mention just a few.
Many solutions have been designed, including the principal component analysis (or
PCA). Under certain conditions, defined formally in Reinsel and Velu (1998), it is possible
to drastically reduce the number of dimensions, while keeping most of the knowledge by
performing a PCA on the data. The approach can be summarized as follows. The
covariance matrix of the data is first computed, and then the corresponding Eigen values
and vectors are evaluated. Because the covariance matrix is symmetric, the Eigen values
and vectors can be easily calculated with a deterministic algorithm like the Jacobi method.

		<p>The amplitude of the Eigen values is representative of the importance of a particular
dimension: the greater the value, the higher the importance. The corresponding Eigen
vectors provide the basis that spans the subspace. It can be shown that the dimensions
corresponding to the smallest Eigen values can be neglected. It can also be proved that
the truncated Eigen decomposition is the decomposition that minimizes the quadratic
error between the truncated decomposition and the real one.<br/>
The algorithm can be better understood by considering a bidimensional data
distribution. Let us suppose that the data are distributed along a regression line. The
Eigen vectors corresponding to this distribution are respectively oriented parallel and
perpendicularly to the regression line; the biggest Eigen value corresponds to the Eigen
vector oriented parallel to the regression line while the smallest Eigen value corresponds
to the Eigen vector normal to the regression line. This particular case shows a
fundamental limitation of the PCA method; i.e., in order to reduce the number of
dimensions, the data must be correlated in the sense that a linear relationship must exist
between them. Even if such a correlation is common in practice, that constraint
constitutes an important limitation.<br/>
Many researchers have tried to overcome the limitation inherent in the linear
relation by working on a generalization of the previous algorithm. A case of particular
interest is the piecewise linear relation, which is an immediate generalization of the
previous case. Instead of assuming a global linear relation, it is assumed that the domain
can be divided into small domains to which a linear relationship applies. That means that
the dimensions reduction is performed on a local basis and not on a global basis as in
the previous case. More details about this method can be found in Chakrabarti and
Menrotra (2000).<br/>
In addition to PCA, other methods like neural networks, clustorization, and latent
semantic indexing can be utilized for dimension reduction. Clustorization allows
representation of the data by a few archetypes corresponding to representative or typical
data within the clusters. Neural networks reduce the data set to a limited number of
classes. The classes can be determined in advance, as it is the case for a multilayer
perceptron and radial basis neural networks, or determined by the network itself, as in
the self-organizing Kohonen map.</p>
		
		<h2>Three-Dimensional Representation and Visualization
of Data</h2>
		<p>Even if the number of dimensions can be reduced, it is well known that the number
of remaining dimensions is much higher than three. Under these circumstances, it is
legitimate to ask whether or not there is a clear advantage to increasing the number of
dimensions from two to three. Doing so has many advantages. It is well known that
complicated data sets are very difficult to visualize in two dimensions. There are many
reasons for that. Let us look at three of them: the amount of information that can be
displayed, the navigation through the data set, and the way data can be represented.<br/>
Let us suppose that N information elements can be displayed in each dimension.
If the data are displayed in two dimensions with a volumetric display, it is theoretically
possible to display up to N<sup>2</sup>
 information elements. If three dimensions are utilized, it is
then possible to display up to N3 information elements simultaneously. In practice, the

		<p>70 Viktor, Paquet & le Roux</p>
		<p>number of displayed information elements is much lower, but this simple example
illustrates the fact that an increase in the number of dimensions dramatically increases
the bandwidth of the display system.<br/>
In visual data mining (Fayyad, Grinstein, & Wierse, 2001), the way data are looked
at or the point of view from which they are considered is very important. A pattern that
can be evident from a certain point of view might be very difficult to see from a different
point of view. Consequently, it is very important that the analyst is able to navigate
through the data in order to determine the best localization for his analysis. It is well
known that bidimensional representations cannot take into account more that one point
of view. Of course, it is always possible to reprocess the data in order to show them from
a different point of view, but in practice that is not convenient. First, it can take a lot of
time to reprocess the data. Such delays can greatly hamper the analysis process. Second,
it is very difficult to determine the right point of view if one cannot navigate through the
data in a non-stepwise manner.<br/>
The above-mentioned problems can be overcome by using an additional dimension.
Three-dimensional data can be viewed from any point of view just by navigating through
them. If the system is properly designed, the navigation can be done in realtime. The
determination of the right point of view is much easier because the user can walk or fly
though the data and look at them from any suitable direction. These systems can be
implemented using a VRML browser, a virtual reality environment, or any suitable
graphical system.</p>
		
		<h2 style="font-weight: bold">Multimedia Standards</h2>
		<p>In order to represent the data, new multimedia alternatives are becoming available,
including the X3D and MPEG-4 standards. X3D allows the analyst to define a graphical
library adapted to the class of problem he is trying to solve. Not only is it possible to
create templates, but also to define a grammar for a specific class of problems. Once the
grammar has been defined, it can be reused transparently with various data sets. More
details about X3D can be found at the Web3D Consortium web site (http://
www.web3d.com).<br/>
MPEG-4 is the first, if not the only, real multimedia format. It can transparently
handle sound, images, videos, and 3-D objects, as well as events, synchronization, and
scripting languages. MPEG-4 is specially adapted to represent very complex multimedia
data sets and to facilitate the interaction between those data sets and the analysts. The
data mining task could be further simplified by using MPEG-7. MPEG-7 is a multimedia
description standard that can describe the content of any multimedia object. That means
that MPEG-7 can provide the analyst with additional information. For a video, this
information could be the duration, the title, and a trailer. Even if the MPEG-4 and MPEG7 standards look very promising, it is too early to draw a conclusion about their
usefulness in data mining. More details about MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 can be found at http:/
